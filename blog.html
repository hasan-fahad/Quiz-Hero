    <h1>1.  what is the difference between map, filter, foreach and find?</h1>
    <p>map --> transform each item in an array and output to a new array without altering the original array<br>
        filter --> remove items of an array based on some criteria without altering the original array<br>
        forEach --> perform some function on each item of an array<br>
        find --> returns the value of the first element that passes a test</p>
    <h1>2. what is the difference between localstorage, section storage & cookies?</h1>
    <p>Local storage object - Stores data with no expiration date<br>
        Session storage object - Stores data for one session (data is lost when the browser tab is closed)<br>
        cookies - storing data with it is a legacy approach to storing data on the client machine.</p>
    <h1>3. what is event loop? How does it work?</h1>
    <p>Event loop - JavaScript has a runtime model based on an event loop, which is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks<br>
        A queue is a data structure that works on the First in First out principle, so as tasks get pushed into the queue, they get out in that same order. Tasks that have been executed by the Web API’s, which are being pushed to the Task Queue, then go back to the Call Stack to get their result printed out.</p>
    <h1>4. Working principal of quiztimer?</h1>
    <p>Time duration of each quiz is stored in the quiz XML file, we retrieve the duration of the quiz and save it in the user’s session as an attribute. When the user submits a question we also submit the time to the controller using custom form submission with JavaScript. So, when we show the next question we display the correct remaining time.</p>
    <h1>5. what is the working procedure of chooseQuiz Function?</h1>
    <p>The choose quiz function will first collect the answers through the questionnaire.  Then it will look for answers through existing data, match each index and ID through quizdata.  If will start from zero serialization.  If the answer is correct then it will remain like that, if it is not correct then the answer will show the correct one.</p>
